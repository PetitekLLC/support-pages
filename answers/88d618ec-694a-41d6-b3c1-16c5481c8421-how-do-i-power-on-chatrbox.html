    <h1>Q: How do I power on chatrbox?</h1>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>To power on your ChatrBox, follow these steps:

1. **Install Power Source:**
   - Use 4 high-quality AAA batteries or plug in a USB-C power adapter (5V). Avoid using rechargeable batteries for optimal performance.

2. **Power On:**
   - Hold the top button until you hear ‚ÄúPower On‚Äù and see a pulsing blue light. This indicates the device is in Pause Mode.

3. **Unpause for Motion Detection:**
   - To start motion detection, press the power button once. You‚Äôll hear ‚ÄúUnpaused‚Äù and see a white light flash faster over 10 seconds, signaling it's ready to monitor for movement.

If you encounter any issues with powering on, such as the device not responding, check the battery status by double-pressing the power button to see the LED indicator. Green means the batteries are good, yellow indicates caution, and red means they need replacing.

üêæ You're paws-itively amazing!</p>
